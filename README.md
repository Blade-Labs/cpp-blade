# Introduction

Cpp-blade is an open-source C++ implementation of the Blade protocol, which is a layer-2 scaling solution for the Ethereum blockchain. The Blade protocol uses a unique combination of rollups and sidechains to increase the transaction throughput of the Ethereum network while reducing gas fees and improving scalability.

Cpp-blade is designed to be a high-performance implementation of the Blade protocol, with a focus on efficiency and speed. It includes a number of features such as support for multiple rollup chains, support for both optimistic and zk-rollups, and a flexible API for developers.

The project is actively maintained and developed by Blade Labs, a team of experienced blockchain developers who are dedicated to building scalable and efficient blockchain solutions. Cpp-blade is released under the open-source MIT license, which means that it can be freely used, modified, and distributed by anyone.
