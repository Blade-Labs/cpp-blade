# Usage

The CPP Blade SDK appears to be a C++ library for various tasks such as I/O operations, string manipulation, and memory management. It seems to be maintained by the Blade Labs organization.

You could potentially use this library in your projects to simplify certain tasks or to improve the efficiency of your code. To use the library, you would need to download or clone the repository and then include the relevant header files in your C++ source code.

However, it's important to note that before using any third-party library in your project, you should carefully review the documentation and code to ensure that it is suitable for your needs and does not introduce any potential security vulnerabilities or compatibility issues. Additionally, it's always a good idea to test any new library thoroughly before using it in a production environment.

#### `accountService.cpp`

This code defines a function named base64ToVector that takes a single argument encoded of type std::string. The function returns a std::vector.

The function first creates a new std::string named decoded that will hold the decoded base64 data. The size of this string is set to the decoded size of the input string using the boost::beast::detail::base64::decoded\_size() function.

Next, the base64 data is decoded using the boost::beast::detail::base64::decode() function. This function takes three arguments: a pointer to the output buffer (\&decoded\[0]), a pointer to the input base64 data (encoded.data()), and the size of the input data (encoded.size()).

After the base64 data is decoded, the decoded string is converted to a std::vector using the constructor that takes two iterators: decoded.begin() and decoded.end() - 1. The -1 is used because the decoded string may contain a null character at the end, which should not be included in the vector.

Finally, the resulting std::vector is returned from the function.

```cpp
  std::vector<unsigned char> base64ToVector(std::string encoded) {
    std::string decoded;
    decoded.resize(boost::beast::detail::base64::decoded_size(encoded.size()));
    boost::beast::detail::base64::decode(&decoded[0], encoded.data(), encoded.size());
    std::vector<unsigned char> output(decoded.begin(), decoded.end() - 1);
    return output;
  }
```

This code defines a function named executeUpdateAccountTransactions that takes four arguments:

A pointer to an object of type Client, named client. A reference to a std::unique\_ptr named privateKey. A std::string named updateAccountTransactionBytes that contains the bytes of the update account transaction. A std::string named transactionBytes that contains the bytes of the transaction. The function returns an integer value.

The purpose of this function is not clear from the code snippet provided. However, based on the argument names and types, it appears to be related to updating an account in a blockchain network using a private key.

The client object likely represents a connection to the blockchain network. The privateKey argument is a reference to a unique pointer that holds the private key needed to sign the transaction. The updateAccountTransactionBytes and transactionBytes arguments are the serialized bytes of the update account transaction and the transaction, respectively.

Without further context, it is difficult to provide a more detailed explanation of what this function does.

```cpp
int executeUpdateAccountTransactions(
        Client* client, 
        std::unique_ptr < ECDSAsecp256k1PrivateKey> &privateKey,
        std::string updateAccountTransactionBytes,
        std::string transactionBytes
  )
```

It then calls the base64ToVector function, passing updateAccountTransactionBytes as an argument. The result is stored in a std::vector named bytes.

auto \[index, variant] = Transaction::fromBytes(bytes);: This line attempts to deserialize an AccountCreateTransaction from the bytes vector using the fromBytes function of the Transaction class template. The auto keyword is used with structured binding to assign the index and variant variables to the corresponding values returned by the fromBytes function. However, this line is also currently commented out. Without further context, it is difficult to determine the purpose of this code. However, it appears to be related to deserializing a transaction from base64-encoded bytes. The commented out lines may provide additional clues about the types of transactions that can be deserialized.

```cpp
    if (updateAccountTransactionBytes != "")
    {
      std::cout << "updateAccountTransactionBytes: " << updateAccountTransactionBytes << std::endl;
      std::vector<unsigned char> bytes = base64ToVector(updateAccountTransactionBytes);
      // Transaction<TransferTransaction>::fromBytes(bytes);
      
      // auto [index, variant] = Transaction<AccountCreateTransaction>::fromBytes(bytes);
                  
      // std::cout << "INDEX: " << index << std::endl;
      // std::cout << "variant: " << variant << std::endl;
    }
```

This code checks if the transactionBytes string is not empty. If it is not empty, it prints the value of transactionBytes to the console using std::cout.

It then calls the base64ToVector function, passing transactionBytes as an argument. The result is stored in a std::vector named bytes.

After the bytes vector is created, there is a TODO comment indicating that a transaction needs to be created and executed. The code that creates and executes the transaction is not shown in this code snippet.

Finally, the function returns an integer value of 0.

Without further context, it is difficult to determine the purpose of this code. However, it appears to be related to executing a transaction in a blockchain network.

```cpp
 if (transactionBytes != "")
    {
      std::cout << "transactionBytes: " << transactionBytes << std::endl;
      std::vector<unsigned char> bytes = base64ToVector(transactionBytes);
      
      // TODO create and execute transaction
    }

    return 0;
  }
```
